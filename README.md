# 📊 Reproducible Analysis of Agronomic Field Trials using R and Quarto

This repository provides reproducible examples of statistical analysis for
agronomic experiments conducted in both experimental stations and farmers'
fields (On-Farm Experiments, OFE). The tutorials are organized in Quarto
documents and cover:

- 📈 Descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis
- 📊 Mixed linear models with and without spatial correlation
- 🔍 Comparison of treatment means using estimated marginal means
- 📉 Polynomial regression and optimal dose prediction
- 🧭 Classification models for site-specific management decisions

All analyses are performed using **R**, with an emphasis on transparency and reproducibility of results.
